# TYPES OF INHERITANCE

## SINGLE INHERITANCE:
Single inheritance is defined as the inheritance in which a derived class is inherited from the only one base class.

## MULTIPLE INHERITANCE:
Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.

## MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE:
If a class is derived from another derived class then it is called multilevel inheritance. So in C++ multilevel inheritance, a class has more than one parent class.

## HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE:
When several classes are derived from common base class it is called hierarchical inheritance.
In C++ hierarchical inheritance, the feature of the base class is inherited onto more than one sub-class.


## HYBRID INHERITANCE:
The inheritance in which the derivation of a class involves more than one form of any inheritance is called hybrid inheritance. Basically C++ hybrid inheritance is combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can also be called multi path inheritance.
